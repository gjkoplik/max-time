# max-time
Python script that takes 4 integers and returns the maximum possible time (00:00 being the minimum, 24:00 being the maximum).

How to run the code:
  * In the command line, change directory to where you downloaded maxTime.py
  * run: python max.py int1 int2 int3 int4
  
Note, the code will not run if you do not specify exactly 4 integers after max.py on the command line.
